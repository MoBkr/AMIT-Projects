# Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding the key factors affecting car prices in the American market. The dataset comes from a consulting firm that conducted market surveys to gather information about various car models. The goal is to build a model that helps predict car prices based on independent variables.

## 🏆 Business Goal
The project aims to:
- Identify significant variables that influence car pricing.
- Build a predictive model to estimate car prices.
- Help businesses understand pricing dynamics and optimize their strategies accordingly.

## 🔍 Tasks
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding the dataset structure
   - Handling missing values
   - Detecting outliers
   - Visualizing key relationships

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature selection
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalization/standardization
   - Data splitting for modeling

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning modeling)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd CarPricePrediction
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CarPrice.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Certain features significantly impact car pricing (e.g., brand, engine size, horsepower).
- Outliers and missing values were handled to improve data quality.
- The preprocessing steps prepared the dataset for future model training.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models for price prediction.
- Optimize feature selection for better accuracy.
- Extend the analysis to include deep learning techniques.
